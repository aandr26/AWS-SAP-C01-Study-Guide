# Disaster Recovery: RPO and RTO

* [Return to table of contents](../../README.md)

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The time between when a failure occurred and the last successful (**recoverable**) copy of necessary business data.
Goal is to *minimize* this length of time.

* The business will help determine this time.

## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The time between occurrence of a disaster and business required systems are operational again.

* **Improve this by decreasing restore time:**
  * Hot Spares
  * Processes:
    * Game days
    * Run books
