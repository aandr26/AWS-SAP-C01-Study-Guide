# Disaster Recovery: RPO and RTO

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The time between when a failure occured and the last successful (**recoverable**) copy of necessary business data.
Goal is to *minimize* this length of time.

* The business will help determine this time.

## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The time between occurance of a disaster and business required systems are operational again.

**Improve this by decreasing restore time:**

* Hot Spares
* Processes:
  * Game days
  * Run books
